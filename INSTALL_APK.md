## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Install

**Error:** "App not installed"
- **Solution:** Uninstall the original app completely first
  ```bash
  adb uninstall fr.mayndrive.app
  ```

### App Crashes on Launch

**Error:** App closes immediately
- **Cause:** Anti-tampering detection (rare)
- **Solution:** Try the android-unpinner method instead:
  ```bash
  pip install android-unpinner
  android-unpinner all mayndrive_original.apk
  ```

### Frida Can't Connect

**Error:** "Failed to attach: unable to find process with name 'Gadget'"
- **Cause:** App not running or Gadget not loaded
- **Solution:** 
  1. Make sure app is open on phone
  2. Wait 5-10 seconds after launching app
  3. Try: `frida-ps -U` to list processes

### No Traffic in Proxy

**Error:** No requests showing up
- **Cause:** Proxy not configured or SSL pinning still active
- **Solution:**
  1. Verify proxy settings on phone
  2. Check Frida script is running (no errors)
  3. Visit http://mitm.it on phone to install certificate
  4. Restart the app

### SSL Certificate Error

**Error:** "Certificate validation failed"
- **Cause:** Certificate pinning not bypassed
- **Solution:**
  1. Verify Frida script is loaded without errors
  2. Check script output for SSL unpinning messages
  3. Try restarting the app while Frida is attached

## Testing Without Traffic Capture

To verify the modified APK works:

1. Install the APK
2. Launch the app
3. Try to login

If the app works normally, the modification was successful! The Frida Gadget is embedded and ready to use.
