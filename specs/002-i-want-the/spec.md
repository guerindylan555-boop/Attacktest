# Feature Specification: Simplified Automation App Interface

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-the`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i want the automation app to have less bouton keep only the neceray one I run to remove as much bouton as possible keep the live check on the service but i want everything background task to run at lauch and close when the windows is closed keep only the bouton to record automation and replay and the captute token that lauch the login user blhck autoamtion and capture the token at the end"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a security tester, I want a simplified automation interface that automatically manages background services so I can focus on the core testing workflows without manual service management overhead.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the automation app is launched, **When** the user opens the interface, **Then** all background services (emulator, proxy, frida) start automatically and the interface shows only essential control buttons
2. **Given** the automation app is running with background services active, **When** the user clicks "Record Automation", **Then** the system begins recording user interactions for later replay
3. **Given** the automation app is running with background services active, **When** the user clicks "Replay Automation", **Then** the system replays previously recorded interactions
4. **Given** the automation app is running with background services active, **When** the user clicks "Capture Token", **Then** the system launches the blhack user login automation and captures authentication tokens at completion
5. **Given** the automation app is running, **When** the user closes the application window, **Then** all background services and processes are automatically terminated

### Edge Cases
- What happens when background services fail to start during app launch?
- How does the system handle service recovery if a background process crashes?
- What occurs if the user tries to start automation while services are still initializing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically start all background services (emulator, proxy, frida) when the application launches
- **FR-002**: System MUST display only essential control buttons: Record Automation, Replay Automation, and Capture Token
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain live status monitoring for all background services
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically terminate all background services when the application window is closed
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to start recording automation interactions with a single button click
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to replay previously recorded automation with a single button click
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to launch blhack user login automation and capture tokens with a single button click
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide visual feedback for service status (running/stopped/error) without manual refresh
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle service startup failures gracefully and provide error feedback to users
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve existing screen capture and logging functionality
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically retry any background service that fails to start up to three times before alerting the user
- **FR-012**: System MUST display the exact error message reported by a service while retrying failed startups
- **FR-013**: System MUST keep the Record, Replay, and Capture buttons disabled until all required services finish initializing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Automation Recording**: Captured user interactions and system responses for replay functionality
- **Service Status**: Current state of background services (emulator, proxy, frida) with health indicators
- **Token Capture Session**: Authentication token extraction process with blhack user automation

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: If a background service fails to start during app launch, how should the Control Center respond? ‚Üí A: Retry failed service up to 3 times, then alert
- Q: During the automatic retry sequence for a failed service, should the UI show the service as ‚ÄúStarting‚Ä¶‚Äù or display a temporary warning? ‚Üí A: Display exact error message
- Q: If the user clicks ‚ÄúRecord Automation‚Äù before all services finish initializing, what should occur? ‚Üí A: Disable button until services ready
