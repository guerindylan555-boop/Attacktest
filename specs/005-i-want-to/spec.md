# Feature Specification: Automation App Stabilization

**Feature Branch**: `005-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to update the autmation app beacasue some fo,ctionality are broken like the bouton to kill and restar in a clean state the app crash the app the replay routine does not folow the clic i saved and also make sure the ui is properly discovered and saved with proper labbeling to make futur automation simpler"

## Problem Overview
- Restart control currently crashes the automation environment when the kill/restart button is pressed, preventing clean-state testing.
- The replay routine drifts from recorded click paths, leading to inconsistent exploit validation and unreliable regression checks.
- UI discovery does not persist labeled widgets, making future automation brittle and hard to extend.

## Goals
- Deliver a stable kill/restart workflow that leaves the target application and supporting services in a known-good state without manual intervention.
- Restore deterministic replay so captured interactions execute exactly as recorded, including timing-sensitive sequences.
- Produce a durable UI catalog with human-readable, unique labels for each discovered element to accelerate future automation work.

## Non-Goals
- Introducing new exploit scenarios beyond those already supported.
- Replacing underlying automation frameworks (Appium, Frida, etc.) unless required to meet stability goals.
- Redesigning the desktop control center UI beyond the elements required to surface restart/replay/labeling health.

## Assumptions
- The control center operates against the existing Android emulator; physical device workflows remain out of scope for this release.
- UI discovery output is stored within the repository (or encrypted artifact storage) alongside replay definitions, with dual JSON/YAML exports maintained together.
- Automation engineers can provide access to recent crash logs and replay traces for diagnosis.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: Which target platforms must the restart workflow support in this release? → A: Emulator only
- Q: What timing tolerance should flag a replay as out of sync? → A: ±250 ms window
- Q: Which format should store the labeled UI catalog for downstream tooling? → A: Both JSON and YAML kept in sync

## Outstanding Questions
None.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An automation engineer uses the control center to reset the target app, rerun the saved replay that proves a vulnerability, and exports an updated UI map so new exploit probes can reference stable element labels.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the control center is connected to the target device and the restart button is idle, **When** the engineer presses the kill/restart button, **Then** the app restarts without crashing and signals readiness within the configured timeout.
2. **Given** a previously recorded replay script, **When** the engineer initiates a replay run, **Then** each recorded click executes in the original order and location, producing the same observable results (logs, screenshots, telemetry).
3. **Given** the discovery tool scans the current UI, **When** the engineer saves the catalog, **Then** each actionable widget has a unique, human-readable label stored in the shared catalog repository.

### Edge Cases
- Restart invoked while a replay is mid-flight must cancel safely, record the interruption, and leave the app in a recoverable state.
- Replay should detect and report missing UI elements (e.g., layout changed) without silently skipping steps.
- UI discovery must handle dynamic IDs by falling back to structural selectors while still assigning stable labels.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The control center MUST terminate and relaunch the target app (and dependent services) without triggering crashes or manual adb intervention.
- **FR-002**: The automation system MUST confirm the environment is in a clean state (e.g., login screen ready, hooks attached) before signaling restart success.
- **FR-003**: Replay executions MUST follow the recorded sequence of interactions with positional accuracy that keeps each click within the original element bounds.
- **FR-004**: Replay routines MUST flag and abort runs when expected UI elements are missing, logging the failing step and capturing diagnostics.
- **FR-005**: The UI discovery workflow MUST capture element metadata (selector, screenshot, hierarchy path) and assign persistent, human-readable labels.
- **FR-006**: Labeled UI catalogs MUST be saved to version-controlled artifacts so future automation can reference them without regenerating.
- **FR-007**: The control center MUST expose status indicators for restart health, replay alignment, and UI labeling freshness to guide operators.
- **FR-008**: All restart, replay, and discovery actions MUST emit structured logs and metrics suitable for observability dashboards.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Kill/restart cycles SHOULD complete within 30 seconds under normal conditions; exceeding the threshold must raise a warning.
- **NFR-002**: Replay drift MUST remain within a ±250 ms window; any deviation beyond the threshold must fail the run.
- **NFR-003**: UI catalogs MUST retain backward compatibility so existing scripts can reference prior labels; breaking changes require migration notes.
- **NFR-004**: Sensitive artifacts (tokens, credentials) captured during restart or replay MUST be redacted or encrypted at rest.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SessionState**: Represents the automation environment status (app PID, hook status, login state); transitions between `idle`, `restarting`, `ready`, `replay_running`, `error`.
- **ReplayScript**: Stores ordered interaction steps with metadata (element label, action type, timing offsets) and references associated evidence (logs, screenshots).
- **UICatalog**: Holds discovered UI nodes with labels, selectors, screenshots, and version metadata to track when elements were last validated.
