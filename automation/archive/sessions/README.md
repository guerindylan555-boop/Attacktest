# Legacy Sessions Module

This folder retains the placeholder for the previous `automation/sessions`
package. The functionality has moved to `automation/session/`.

Any remaining references should use the new module structure; delete this
archive entry once downstream branches confirm they no longer rely on the
legacy import path.
