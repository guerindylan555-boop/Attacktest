FIX SUMMARY - RUN_DECRYPT_CAPTURE.bat Now Works!
====================================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
RUN_DECRYPT_CAPTURE.bat captured 0 items because capture_DECRYPT.js was missing the coroutine hooks
that actually capture unlock/lock requests.

capture_DECRYPT.js had ONLY:
  - Cipher.doFinal hooks (for decryption)
  - SSLEngine hooks (for SSL/TLS)
  ❌ MISSING: B4.Y4 and B4.M4 coroutine hooks that capture HTTP requests!

SOLUTION:
---------
Changed capture_decrypt.py to use capture_COMPLETE_SOLUTION.js which has ALL hooks:
  ✅ B4.Y4.invokeSuspend (unlock coroutine) - CAPTURES UNLOCK HTTP REQUESTS
  ✅ B4.M4.invokeSuspend (lock coroutine) - CAPTURES LOCK HTTP REQUESTS
  ✅ javax.crypto.Cipher.doFinal (cipher decryption)
  ✅ Socket.io emit/packet (real-time notifications)
  ✅ OkHttp RealCall.execute (HTTP backup)
  ✅ Native sendto/recvfrom (raw UDP packets)

WHAT CHANGED:
-------------
1. capture_decrypt.py:
   - SCRIPT_FILE = "capture_COMPLETE_SOLUTION.js" (was "capture_DECRYPT.js")
   - Updated output messages

2. RUN_DECRYPT_CAPTURE.bat:
   - Fixed frida-server startup (uses nohup, no longer hangs)
   - Updated messages to reflect complete capture

UNIFIED SCRIPTS:
----------------
Both RUN_CAPTURE.bat and RUN_DECRYPT_CAPTURE.bat now:
  - Use the same working frida-server startup method
  - Use capture_COMPLETE_SOLUTION.js with all hooks
  - Capture unlock/lock + cipher + UDP in one script

HOW TO USE:
-----------
.\RUN_DECRYPT_CAPTURE.bat

Then:
1. Wait for "[+] Hooked B4.Y4.invokeSuspend" messages
2. App will auto-launch
3. Unlock/lock a scooter
4. Watch for:
   - [COROUTINE] = HTTP unlock/lock with Bearer token + scooter serial
   - [UDP CIPHER PLAINTEXT] = Decrypted telemetry
   - [UDP SEND/RECV] = Raw encrypted packets

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
----------------
[COROUTINE] Unlock/Lock coroutine triggered (B4.Y4)
  Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
  Scooter Serial: TUF061
  Latitude: 48.856614
  Longitude: 2.352222
