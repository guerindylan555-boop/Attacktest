# MaynDrive Security Exploitation Demo - Quick Start Guide

## 🚨 WARNING: AUTHORIZED TESTING ONLY

This tool demonstrates **real attack vectors** against the MaynDrive API. Only use on systems you own or have explicit written permission to test. Unauthorized security testing is illegal.

---

## 🎯 What This Tool Does

This interactive web application demonstrates how attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the MaynDrive API to gain unauthorized admin access. It includes:

1. **Scope Escalation Attack** - Request admin privileges during login
2. **JWT Token Manipulation** - Tamper with authentication tokens
3. **Admin Endpoint Enumeration** - Access admin endpoints with user tokens
4. **Mass Vehicle Unlock** - Demonstrate fleet-wide compromise
5. **Device Spoofing** - Bypass device-based security controls

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

```bash
# Required
pip install flask requests

# Optional (for JWT manipulation test)
pip install pyjwt
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask requests pyjwt
```

### Step 2: Launch the Web App

```bash
python exploit_demo_webapp.py
```

### Step 4: Enter Test Credentials

Enter your MaynDrive account credentials:
- **Email**: Your test account email
- **Password**: Your test account password

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Use a **test account** in a **test environment**. Never use production credentials!

### Step 5: Run Exploits

Click on any exploit card to test that specific vulnerability, or click **"Execute All Exploits"** to run the complete test suite.

## 📊 Understanding Results

### 🚨 VULNERABLE Results

If an exploit shows **VULNERABLE**:
- ✅ The exploit works - system has this vulnerability
- ❌ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Review `SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md` for fixes
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Fix immediately if marked as critical severity

### ✅ SECURE Results

If an exploit shows **SECURE**:
- ✅ System is protected against this attack
- ✅ Proper authorization/validation is in place
- 🟢 No action needed for this vulnerability

### ❓ UNCLEAR Results

If results are unclear:
- May need manual inspection
- Check the detailed JSON response
- Review server logs

## 🎭 Detailed Exploit Descriptions

### 1️⃣ Scope Escalation Attack

**What it tests:**
- Can regular users request "admin" scope during login?
- Does the backend trust client-provided role parameters?

**How it works:**
```python
# Attacker modifies login request
api.login(email, password, scope="admin")  # ⚠️ Client-controlled!
```

**If vulnerable:**
- Any user can become admin by changing one parameter
- **Impact**: Complete fleet control

**Fix:**
- Remove `scope` parameter from login endpoint
- Determine roles SERVER-SIDE from database

---

### 2️⃣ JWT Token Manipulation

**What it tests:**
- Can JWT tokens be tampered with?
- Does the backend properly validate token signatures?

**How it works:**
```python
# Attacker decodes token
payload = jwt.decode(token, verify_signature=False)

# Attacker modifies role/scope
payload['scope'] = 'admin'

# Attacker re-signs with weak key
fake_token = jwt.encode(payload, 'weak_key', algorithm='HS256')
```

**If vulnerable:**
- Attackers can forge admin tokens
- **Impact**: Bypass authentication entirely

**Fix:**
- Use RS256 (asymmetric) instead of HS256
- Always validate signature on backend
- Use strong, random secret keys

---

### 3️⃣ Admin Endpoint Enumeration

**What it tests:**
- Can admin endpoints be accessed with user tokens?
- Are authorization checks actually implemented?

**How it works:**
```python
# Login as regular user
api.login(email, password, scope="user")

# Try to access admin endpoints
api.unlock_vehicle_admin(serial, lat, lng)  # Should fail!
```

**If vulnerable:**
- Admin endpoints only check token validity, not role
- **Impact**: Unauthorized admin operations

**Fix:**
- Add role-based authorization checks to EVERY admin endpoint
- Verify user permissions against database

---

### 4️⃣ Mass Vehicle Unlock

**What it tests:**
- Can attacker unlock multiple vehicles rapidly?
- Is there rate limiting on admin operations?

**How it works:**
```python
# If attacker gains admin access
for vehicle in fleet:
    api.unlock_vehicle_admin(vehicle, lat, lng, force=True)
```

**If vulnerable:**
- No rate limiting on destructive operations
- **Impact**: Fleet-wide disruption

**Fix:**
- Implement rate limiting per user/endpoint
- Add alerting for suspicious bulk operations
- Require additional authentication for mass actions

---

### 5️⃣ Device Spoofing

**What it tests:**
- Does backend validate device information?
- Can attackers use fake device IDs?

**How it works:**
```python
fake_device = {
    "uuid": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "platform": "attacker_os",
    "manufacturer": "HACKER"
}
api.login(email, password, device=fake_device)
```

**If vulnerable:**
- Device-based security controls can be bypassed
- **Impact**: Account sharing, easier token theft

**Fix:**
- Implement device registration/approval
- Limit active devices per account
- Detect and block suspicious device patterns

---

## 📈 Interpreting the Results

### Critical Severity (🔴)
- **Immediate action required**
- Can lead to complete system compromise
- Fix within 24-48 hours

### High Severity (🟠)
- **Action needed soon**
- Significant security risk
- Fix within 1-2 weeks

### Medium Severity (🟡)
- **Should be addressed**
- Moderate risk
- Fix within 1 month
