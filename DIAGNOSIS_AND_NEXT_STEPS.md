# Diagnosis & Next Steps

## Current Issue: "Bad Gateway" Errors

### What's Happening
The exploit demo webapp is showing:
```
‚ùå Error: Unexpected token 'B', "Bad Gateway" is not valid JSON
```

This has been **FIXED** in the latest commit, but the **root cause** is that the production API is unreachable.

---

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

1. **Frontend Error Handling** (`templates/index.html`)
   - Now checks content-type before parsing JSON
   - Gracefully handles plain text error responses
   - No more "Unexpected token" errors

2. **Backend Error Handling** (`mayn_drive_api.py`)
   - Separate handling for timeouts, connection errors, etc.
   - Detailed error messages with context

3. **Flask Endpoints** (`exploit_demo_webapp.py`)
   - Return HTTP 200 with error details in JSON body
   - User-friendly error messages

**Result:** The webapp no longer crashes, but still can't test exploits because the API is down.

---

## üîç Root Cause: API Unreachable

The production API at `https://api.knotcity.io` is returning 502 Bad Gateway or not responding at all.

### Possible Reasons:
1. ‚úÖ **API is temporarily down** - Server maintenance or issues
2. ‚úÖ **Rate limiting/blocking** - API blocks automated requests or unknown IPs
3. ‚úÖ **Geographic restrictions** - API only accepts requests from certain regions
4. ‚úÖ **Wrong endpoint** - We might have the wrong URL or path

## üéØ Solution: Capture Real Traffic from Phone

Since we can't reach the production API from your computer, you need to:

### Step 1: Capture Traffic from MaynDrive App

**Easiest Method: HTTP Toolkit**
1. Download: https://httptoolkit.tech/
2. Connect your Android phone via USB
3. Open MaynDrive app and perform actions
4. Export captured traffic as HAR file

**Alternative: mitmproxy**
- See detailed instructions in `MITM_PROXY_SETUP.md`
- Use `ssl-unpinning.js` if you hit certificate pinning issues

### Step 2: Analyze Captured Traffic

```bash
# Use the traffic analyzer tool
python traffic_analyzer.py captured_traffic.har
```

This will show you:
- ‚úÖ **Actual API endpoints** being called
- ‚úÖ **Required headers** (API keys, device IDs, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Request/response formats**
- ‚úÖ **Authentication flow details**

### Step 3: Update API Client

Based on what you discover, update `mayn_drive_api.py`:

```python
# Example: If you find an API key is required
self.session.headers.update({
    'User-Agent': 'Knot-mayndrive v1.1.34 (android)',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-API-Key': 'discovered_api_key',  # Add if found
    'X-Device-ID': device_uuid  # Add if required
})
```

### Step 4: Re-test Exploits

Once the API client is updated with real data, the exploit demo will work!

## üìã Quick Checklist

### What You Should Do Now:

- [ ] Read `PHONE_TRAFFIC_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Choose your tool: HTTP Toolkit (easiest) or mitmproxy
- [ ] Capture traffic from MaynDrive app on your phone
- [ ] Analyze captured traffic with `traffic_analyzer.py`
- [ ] Verify the actual endpoints and parameters
- [ ] Update `mayn_drive_api.py` if needed
- [ ] Test with `test_api_connection.py`
- [ ] Re-run exploit demo

---

## üß™ Testing Right Now

You can test if the API is reachable:

```bash
# Test API connection
python test_api_connection.py

# If it works:
# ‚úÖ Status 401/400 = API is UP (credentials wrong but server responding)
# ‚ùå Status 502/503 = API is DOWN
# ‚ùå Timeout/Connection Error = API is UNREACHABLE
```

## üéØ Expected Outcome

After capturing phone traffic, you'll know:

1. **Is the API URL correct?**
   - Maybe it's `https://api.knotcity.io/v2/` instead?
   - Or a completely different domain?

2. **What headers are required?**
   - API keys
   - Device identifiers
   - Platform indicators

3. **Can you really request admin scope?**
   - Does `"scope": "admin"` work in login?
   - Or is there a different mechanism?

4. **What admin endpoints exist?**
   - Are they at `/admin` paths?
   - Or protected differently?

## üí° Alternative: Mock API Server

If you can't reach the production API, you could create a mock server for testing:

```python
# mock_mayndrive_api.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/application/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    data = request.json
    scope = data.get('scope', 'user')
    
    # VULNERABLE: Accept any scope
    return jsonify({
        'access_token': 'mock_token_' + scope,
        'refresh_token': 'mock_refresh',
        'expires_in': 3600,
        'scope': scope  # Returns whatever was requested!
    })

@app.route('/api/application/vehicles/unlock/admin', methods=['POST'])
def admin_unlock():
    return jsonify({'success': True, 'message': 'Vehicle unlocked'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=8082)
```

Then test against it:
```python
api = MaynDriveAPI(environment='local_1')  # Points to localhost:8082
```

## üìû Need Help?

If you're stuck:
1. Check the logs from `docker-compose up`
2. Try `test_api_connection.py` first
3. Review `PHONE_TRAFFIC_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md`
4. Make sure your phone is on the same network as your computer (for mitmproxy)
