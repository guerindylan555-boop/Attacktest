# 🔧 Deployment Fix Applied

## Issue Resolved

**Problem:** Application was crashing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jwt'`

**Solution:** Added missing dependencies (Flask and PyJWT) to `requirements.txt`

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Updated `requirements.txt` to include:
```
flask>=3.0.0      # Web framework (was missing)
PyJWT>=2.8.0      # JWT token handling (was missing)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps in Dockploy

### Option 1: Auto-Redeploy (If Enabled)
If you enabled auto-deploy, Dockploy will automatically rebuild your application with the new dependencies in ~2-3 minutes.

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to your Dockploy dashboard
2. Find your application: **"attak-front-hqsrq3"**
3. Click **"Redeploy"** or **"Rebuild"** button
4. Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)

---

## 📊 Verify Deployment

Once redeployed, your application should start successfully. Check:

### 1. Check Container Logs
```bash
# In Dockploy, view logs and look for:
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

### 2. Test the Application
Visit your Dockploy URL and you should see:
```
🚨 MaynDrive Security Exploitation Demo
⚠️ WARNING: AUTHORIZED TESTING ONLY
```

### 3. Test Functionality
- Enter test credentials
- Click any exploit button
- Should see results (not errors)

---

## 🎯 Expected Build Output

After redeploying, you should see:
```
Building wheels for collected packages: frida-tools, pyperclip
Successfully installed Flask-3.1.0 PyJWT-2.8.0 ...
Docker Deployed: ✅
```

And the application should start with:
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║   MaynDrive Security Exploitation Demo                   ║
║   Running at: http://0.0.0.0:5000                         ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## 🔍 If Still Not Working

### Check Container Status
In Dockploy dashboard:
- Container should show: **Running** (green)
- If **Crashed** (red): View logs for error details

### Common Issues:

#### Issue: "Port already in use"
**Solution:** Dockploy handles port mapping automatically. If this appears, check if another service is using port 5000.

#### Issue: "Still seeing old error"
**Solution:** Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5) or clear browser cache.

#### Issue: "502 Bad Gateway"
**Solution:** Wait 30-60 seconds after deployment. Container needs time to fully start.

## 🎉 Success Indicators

✅ Container status: **Running**  
✅ Logs show: **"Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000"**  
✅ Web page loads without errors  
✅ Can enter credentials  
✅ Exploits execute and show results
